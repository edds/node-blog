# Node-blog

This is a very simple blogging engine that doesn't yet have a functioning admin interface. It makes use of [djangode][1], [postgres-js][2], [showdown][3], [tmpl-node][4] and [underscore][5].

## Installation

To setup you first need to edit `settings.js`. You then need to run:

    $ node ./setup.js

To start the server run:

    $ node ./index.js
